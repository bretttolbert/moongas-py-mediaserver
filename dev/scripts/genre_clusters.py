"""
Note: I used this script to generate some of the genre cluster links
It's only based on the genre name (e.g. "Classic Rock"), not the quality 
of the music, so it's not very good, e.g. it groups "Glam Rock" with "Goth Rock", 
so some manual editing was still required. Otherwise this code could be 
integrated into the app. Nonetheless the script was very helpful and could
easily be repurposed for myriad other uses.
TODO: Research more advanced forms of genre classification and introduce
genre tag-checking or auto-tagging feature.
